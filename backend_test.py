üö® CRITICAL SECURITY TESTING: Fake Judge Detection System
========================================================

This test suite verifies the newly implemented fake judge detection system
to ensure it properly identifies obviously fake judges and prevents security vulnerabilities.

Test Categories:
1. Critical Fake Judge Detection Tests
2. Realistic Judge Tests  
3. Judge Validation Endpoints
4. Confidence Level Testing
5. Error Handling
